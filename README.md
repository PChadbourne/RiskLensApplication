# RiskLensApplication
Code sample for application process at RiskLens

Contains two source code files, one in python, one in Java.
The python file was done as an initial script/proof of concept to ensure that my methodology was sound and that the results being given were as expected. It is much more focused on treating the problem like a quick question to solve without much fanfare.

The Java program is written as if the problem being solved is much more complicated or is planned to be expanded upon, and as such has a significant deal of additional groundwork that is not necessary for a simple problem.

Furthermore the Java program is entirely contatined within a single source file purely to promote ease of reading, without having to repeatedly change tabs. Ordinarily classes would be placed in their own source files.
